            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>CASHEW VODKA SAUCE</p>
            <ul>
                <li>4-5 cups basic, awesome pasta sauce (replace butter with coconut oil)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup triple distilled vodka</li>
                <li>1 cup raw cashews, soaked 4+ hours</li>
                <li>Heavy pinch of fine sea salt</li>
            </ul>

                <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>2-4 small leaves of kale</li>
                <li>1/2 cup raw sunflower seeds, soaked 4+ hours</li>

                <li>1/2 cup non-dairy milk</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>2 1/2 cups semolina flour, divided</li>
                <li>1 cup warm water</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the tomato sauce and vodka to a large saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 20 minutes, until the sauce is slightly reduced and the alcohol is cooked off. Remove from heat and let cool for 10-15 minutes, then add the sauce, cashews, and sea salt to the base of a high speed blender, such as a Vitamix. Blend on high speed just until smooth then transfer to a jar (or two) and refrigerate until ready to use. The vodka sauce will keep in the refrigerator for up to one week.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425˚F. Toss the broccoli, garlic, and olive oil together in a small mixing bowl then spread evenly over a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake at 425˚F for 10-15 minutes, just until the garlic starts to brown. Remove from heat and set aside to cool for at least 10 minutes. Once cool, add the broccoli and garlic to the base of a high speed blender, along with the kale, strained sunflower seeds, nutritional yeast, sea salt, and non-dairy milk. Blend on high speed until smooth, scraping down the sides as needed. Transfer filling to a small jar and chill until ready to use. The filling will keep in the refrigerator for up to three days</li>
                
                <li>Prepare the pasta by adding 2 1/4 cups of the flour to a large mixing bowl (add a heavy pinch of salt if you'd like, although it's not necessary). Create a well in the center and add the oil and water; mix with a wooden spoon (or your hands) until combined. If the dough feels too wet, mix in the remaining 1/4 cup of flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. The dough should still feel slightly damp. Divide the dough in half and knead each half for 2-3 minutes. Wrap in plastic and set aside to rest for 25-30 minutes.</li>

                <li>Now would be the time to clean your kitchen and have a glass of wine. No, really.</li>

                <li>Line a flat surface with parchment paper and sprinkle (generously) with semolina flour. Take one piece of dough and roll it out until it's 1/8″ thick, making sure to liberally flour the dough while you work. Using your ravioli stamp, make light impressions on half the dough, leaving about 1/4″ between each impression. Using a 1 1/2 teaspoon cookie scoop, drop the filling in the middle of each impression, then carefully fold the other half of the dough over the filling. </li>
               
                <li>Gently pat the areas around the filling, then use a 1 3/4" ravioli stamp to cut each piece of ravioli and move them to the side. Repeat this process with the second piece of dough. When you're left with the scraps, wet your hands and knead them into one large ball and re-roll, making sure to liberally flour your work surface. Continue wetting your hands and rolling the scraps until you can't make anymore ravioli. I got 60 pieces of ravioli and a single-serving of farfalle out of the dough.</li>
                
                <li>Line a large baking sheet with a wire rack; set aside. In a large saucepan over medium heat, bring water and a heavy pinch of salt to a boil. Once boiling, add 1/3 of the ravioli and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until they're floating on the surface. Spoon them out onto the prepared baking sheet and let dry for about one minute. Transfer to a large bowl and drizzle with a bit of olive oil (no more than 1 teaspoon) and gently toss to combine. Continue process with remaining ravioli. At this point you can either freeze the ravioli for later use or move on to the main dish.</li>
                
                <li>Preheat oven to 350˚F. In a large baking dish, such as a dutch oven, spoon 1/2 cup of the cashew vodka sauce into the bottom of the dish and layer with ravioli. Continue layering until you've used at least 40 of the ravioli and end with a thin layer of sauce (don't worry about covering all of the ravioli). Cover dish with a lid (or foil) and bake at 350˚F for 15-20 minutes. Top with chopped kale and sunflower seeds, if desired. Serve immediately. Will keep refrigerated for up to three days. Reheat in the oven as needed.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Yield: 55-60 1 3/4" ravioli pieces</p>
